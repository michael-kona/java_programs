<P><B>The following are the steps to related to be taken to run the existing 
part of the application :</B> 
<P>
<OL>
  <LI>Download <A 
  href="http://www.srikanthtechnologies.com/javaee/projects/scm.zip">scm.zip</A> 
  and unzip it into <B>webapps </B>directory of Tomcat installation directory. 
  <LI>Make sure you copy <B>classes111.zip </B>( after renaming it to 
  classes111.jar) or <B>classes12.jar</B> into WEB-INF/lib directory 
  <LI>Compile javabeans in <B>WEB-INF/classes/scm</B> directory. Run batch file 
  <B>s.bat</B> before compiling javabeans. You may have to make necessary 
  changes to batch file depending on the directory structure of your system. 
  <LI>Create account <B>scm</B> with password <B>scm</B> in Oracle Database 
  using the following command after you log in as SYSTEM or INTERNAL. <PRE>   create user scm identified by scm;
   grant connect, resource to mft;
   </PRE>
  <LI>Create required tables in Oracle using TABLES.TXT file and also insert 
  some sample data. 
  <LI>Start Tomcat 
  <LI>Run the application using the following url: <PRE>   http://localhost:8080/scm/login.jsp
 </PRE>
  <LI>You should see login page of the application. </LI></OL>
<H3>Deploying Web Application In Tomcat of JBoss </H3>The following procedure 
explains how to deploy a web application MFT, developed with Standalone Tomcat, 
into Tomcat that is embeded into JBoss. This eliminates the need to use two 
servers - JBOSS and TOMCAT. Instead by starting JBOSS, we can use Web 
applications and related EJBs. 
<P>
<UL>
  <LI>Create a .war file for web application SCM by getting into <B>scm</B> 
  directory of <B>webapps</B> directory of TOMCAT as follows: <PRE>     <B>jar cfv  scm.war  . </B>
  </PRE>
  <LI>Copy <B>scm.war</B> file into <B>JBOSS_HOME\server\default\deploy</B> 
  directory. 
  <LI>Access the application using <B>http://localhost:8080/scm/login.jsp </B>.
